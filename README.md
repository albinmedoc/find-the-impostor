## 🎮 How to Play

### 📋 **Game Setup**

1. **Configure Players**: Set up 3-10 players with custom names
2. **Choose Categories**: Select word categories (animals, food, movies, etc.) or create your own
3. **Set Impostors**: Decide how many players will be impostors (1-3 recommended)
4. **Optional Hints**: Enable hints to help impostors blend in

### 🎭 **Role Assignment**

- **👥 Regular Players**: Know the secret word and must work together to find impostors
- **🕵️ Impostors**: Don't know the secret word but can see optional hints to help them guess

### 📱 **Word Reveal Phase**

- Players take turns looking at their phone/device privately
- **Regular players** see the exact secret word (e.g., "Pizza")
- **Impostors** see only category hints (e.g., "Food item, often round, has toppings")

### 💬 **Discussion Rounds**

1.  Each player says **one word** related to the secret word

- Regular players try to give clues without being too obvious
- Impostors try to guess and blend in based on others' words

2. **Final Discussion**: After 2 Rounds open a discussion about who might be the impostor

### 🗳️ **Voting & Results**

- All players vote for who they think is the impostor
- Reveal roles and see who won:
  - **Regular Players Win**: If they correctly identify all impostors
  - **Impostors Win**: If they avoid detection or correctly guess the secret word

### 🎯 **Strategy Tips**

- **For Regular Players**: Give specific but not obvious clues, watch for players who seem unsure
- **For Impostors**: Listen carefully to others' clues, ask strategic questions, don't be too vague or too specific
